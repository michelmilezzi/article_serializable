> A small project showing serializable transactions usage and capability, made as part of this article https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/draft/preview/7249171219676057601 (WIP).
> The goal of this project is to have a self-contained test showing a possible use-case of SERIALIZABLE Isolation Level.

## üìú Overview

This small app emulates a bank account withdrawal process.

### API Endpoint: Withdrawals

This endpoint allows users to initiate a withdrawal request. If you pass `serializable` parameter as false (or don't pass it at all), the withdrawal request will be handled using `READ COMMITED` isolation level, which will fail validating the daily withdrawal limit of $5000 in case of two or more concurrent requests for same user. Otherwise, if you pass `serializable` as true, the request will be handle using `SERIALIZABLE` isolation level, protecting the database from an inconsistent state.

Be aware that this endpoint has a sleep of 5 seconds before committing changes on database. This is needed to reproduce the scenario without having a high load environment. You can check it at [WithdrawalService](services/withdrawalService.js#L71).

#### HTTP Method

`POST`

#### Endpoint URL

`/withdrawals`

#### Query parameters

`serializable={false|true}`

#### Request Headers

- **Content-Type:** `application/json`

#### Request Body

The request body should be a JSON object with the following fields:

```json
{
  "amount": 1000,
  "user": 1
}
```

## üíª Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have met the following requirements:

- NodeJS v18 or above
- Docker v27 or above

## ‚òï Preparing

Clone this repo and issue a `npm install` command at the root directory to install its dependencies.

## üöÄ Running

To run this project, you have two options: either start the application and send concurrent requests manually (in that case you also need a PostgreSQL instance running locally), or run the integration tests, which include this scenario and starts a PostgreSQL container automatically.

### Running manually

- Create a `.env` file and add your PostgreSQL URI there, such as `DATABASE_URL=postgres://myuser:mypass@localhost:5432/mydatabase`.
- Issue a `npx sequelize-cli db:migrate` to run all database migrations (create tables, etc.)
- Now you're good to go, just issue a `npm start` to start the app
- Then you can send requests, e.g.:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'http://localhost:3000/withdrawals?serializable=false' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
	"amount": 1000,
	"user": 1
}'
```

Remember to run at least 2 requests simultaneously for same user and to play with `serializable` query parameter.

### Running integration tests

- Issue a `npm test` and inspect test results

We're covering these scenarios:

1. Two concurrent requests for same user to be handled by `READ COMMITED` isolation level. This test is intentionally failing due to inability of applying the limit.
2. Two concurrent requests for same user to be handled by `SERIALIZABLE` isolation level. This test is running fine.
